1.  stdint is a header file that declares and allows users to use integers of 
    various widths, and not restricted to the 4 Byte int.
2.  They are all integers of various widths. These can be used when we know 
    exactly what kind of values we will be storing in these variables, like
    memory addresses for example.
3.  BYTE - 1 Byte
    DWORD - 4 Bytes
    LONG - 4 Bytes
    WORD - 2 Bytes
4.  0x42 0x4D
    Represents BM in ASCII.
5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the entire BMP file.
    biSize is the number of bytes required for the INFOHEADER.
6.  In some cases, where every pixel's data is stored from top to bottom, 
    biHeight will have a negative value.
7.  biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel.
8.  fopen might return NULL if it is unable to create the file due to lack of
    free space or limited system rights.
9.  The third arg of fread() takes in the number of elements to read. Since we 
    use fread() to read one Bitmap's file and info header, the third argument 
    of fread() is one as each bitmap has only one header.
10. If bi.biWidth is 3, padding gets the value 0.
11. fseek() is used to skip over few bytes from current indicator while reading
    a file's data. (Like an offset)
12. SEEK_CUR offsets the file position indicator with respect to the current 
    position indicator.
